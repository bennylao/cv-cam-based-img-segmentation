# cv-CAM-based-img-segmentation

## üìñ Overview

This project explores **weakly supervised** learning techniques for image segmentation, focusing primarily on the Grad-CAM++ method ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11063)).

GradCAM++ requires only image-level labels for training, eliminating the need for pixel-level annotations. The project aims to evaluate the performance of Grad-CAM++ on the Oxford Pets dataset, comparing it with fully supervised methods.

In additional, we experimented with **self-training** and **superpixels SLIC** to improve the performance of Grad-CAM++.
