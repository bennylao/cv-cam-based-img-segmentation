## Noteboooks and Scripts

Experiments and results are stored in the `notebooks` directory. Separate scripts are also provided for training and evaluation.

To run the scripts, install all the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, nevigate to the root directory, where the `README.md` file is located, and run the following commands to train and evaluate the models.

### Training

    ```shell
    python -m src.train.train_cam_slic_deeplab
    ```

- GradCAM++ deeplabv3 resnet50

    ```shell
    python -m src.train.train_cam_deeplab
    ```

- GradCAM++ Unet

    ```shell
    python -m src.train.train_cam_unet
    ```

- baseline deeplabv3 resnet50 model

    ```shell
    python -m src.train.train_baseline_deeplab
    ```

- baseline Unet model

    ```shell
    python -m src.train.train_baseline_unet
    ```

### Evaluation

- GradCAM++ deeplabv3 resnet50 with self-training and superpixels slic

    ```shell
    python -m src.eval.eval_cam_slic_deeplab
    ```
